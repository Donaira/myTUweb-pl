The habit of spending some of your money or time on good deeds is just as important as saving or earning money. For some reason, we tend to downplay this, because at first glance it may seem useless to children. Nevertheless, there are many scientific and sociological studies proving that by giving to another person, we experience a huge psychological satisfaction. Man is by nature a social being, and it is important for us to help and take care of each other. This is how we fill ourselves with a sense of happiness. So it is absolutely necessary to pass this habit on to your children from an early age! And the Christmas period is perhaps the most favourable time to teach sharing, discuss the meaning of good deeds and put it into practice.

This is the case with donations too. What if we talk about doing good deeds, but we don't do it ourselves? The Christmas period is a particularly favourable time to show your children a good example. There are a lot of charity events and initiatives out there at the moment, so all you have to do is choose where and how much you are going to donate. Just don't forget to share this with your child, tell them where and why you are making a donation. Involve the child in this process as well – do the money transfer together, buy the necessary supplies together and take them to the selected organizations, such as a nursing home. Even a simple action is enough – to donate via an SMS or buy products for children within the organized promotions in the store. And, of course, it is important to discuss with the child why it is important to make donations, how it can be done, and how they feel after making a donation.

The next step should be the allocation of the child's personal money for good deeds. This way he will learn much faster, because he himself will feel in practice what it means to give part of his money. But the feeling of happiness and joy will be much greater.

All they have to do is to choose from activities such as, volunteering in an animal shelter or in a nursing home, helping an elderly housemate or teaching them how to use a computer or a smartphone, feeding birds or forest animals – as all of these are also good deeds. You can also suggest reviewing toys or books that are no longer in use, clothes or shoes that have become small, and giving them to those who are experiencing difficulties.

Children are naturally inclined to help, although sometimes it may seem like the opposite. Our job is to show how, talk and discuss, motivate and offer to take the initiative.

Although the child's habit of donating develops quickly, it takes time and effort. But in the long run it will bring great benefits to the relationship with the child, their happiness, and possibly, improve the financial situation in the future. I wish that you take advantage of this wonderful festive period and start developing this wonderful and useful habit together with your children. Don't forget – donating is not a duty or an obligation. This desire must ultimately come naturally from the heart. After all, it's not the size of the donation that matters, but the process itself.
