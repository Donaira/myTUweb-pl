There are many folks who plan the gifts for family and friends early. Naturally, we cannot avoid the increase in expenditure during this period, so starting to prepare early is healthy not only for your wallet, but also for the nerves. The festive spirit of Christmas and its subsequent hustle and bustle has its own charm. However, running around the shops at the last minute, cramming in queues, complicating search for gifts and finally buying out of necessity, causes a lot of stress and usually requires more expenses than planned.

After all, this is basic budgeting. When you include children, the benefits will be far greater. Children learn personal finance from the example set by parents. So, if we act spontaneously and aimlessly, buy gifts at the last minute, there is a high probability that our children will do the same in the future. Discuss together what kind of gifts will make your loved ones happy. It is much more fun to give thoughtful, sincerely chosen and necessary gifts. And if you don't prepare in advance, you will end up buying out of necessity. Children have the ability to make interesting suggestions and recommendations that we don't even think about ourselves. Also, if you start preparing in advance, you are more likely to get discounts too. Often, various stores advertise discounts on toys, books, home accessories, etc early on. So, if you manage to take advantage of the promotions, you will end up saving a lot of money. This is a useful lesson for children, because they will see that planning and preparation make managing money much more efficient.

This allows you to avoid excess purchases, unnecessary items and – saves money. If you spend the holidays in a larger group, it is worthwhile using this method and including older children as well. A larger gift budget can be negotiated as only one gift will be purchased for the person drawn, not everyone. Alternatively, you can set a small budget too – after all, Christmas is more of a good time together! And of course, the process of presenting each other gifts on the festive evening, while becoming evident who gifted who, can become interesting and memorable not only for children, but also for adults.

Excessive consumption, intense advertising influence buying behaviour and puts gifts first, which become more and more expensive and important. It is easy to forget the real meaning of these holidays – being with loved ones, sharing attention, carrying out good deeds, and sacrifice. I understand that for children it is a magical holiday that they look forward to all year. So, let's give them joy with gifts. As for adults, I don't think it's worthwhile spending a lot of money. Personally, this period is about upholding traditions, warmth, and sharing goodness. Hence handmade gifts seem to be the sincerest choice. Various jams, bundles of dried berries/fruits, cookies and handmade candies, curated tea, spice or herbs can become an unforgettable gift. Be sure to include the children in this process! Perhaps they themselves have interests in making handicrafts. The time spent together preparing Christmas gifts will be fun and foster a bond between each other. And the children will understand that it is not the bought gifts that create joy, but the ones we create ourselves!
