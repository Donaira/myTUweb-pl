Parents are often confused; when should I start? How much money should I allocate? How regularly should I give it? And in general, to give or not to give? Unequivocally, YES! Pocket money is the best way for a child to learn and master how to deal with money. It allows them to be smart with money, make mistakes and learn from them. The mistakes a child makes in managing their money now will be nothing compared to the serious financial repercussions they may face as an adult when they haven’t learned the art early 🧐.

Since children's maturity and abilities are subjective, I would advise not to have strict age limits. The most important thing is to start teaching children how to count money properly by introducing notes and coins (for example, how many cents make up one euro, etc.). This way, they start calculating the change they received in the store or how much money they need to buy a desired item.

Interestingly, you can start much earlier than that, but with smaller amounts of money. After all, starting to attend school changes many aspects of a child's life – a different daily routine, more independence and a sense of responsibility. On top of that, parents start giving pocket money, and sometimes even without any explanation - how to spend, distribute, plan, calculate and refrain from spending. If you start giving pocket money before the first grade, even just 10-20 cents a day, the child will already be familiar with the subtle nuances of money management even before school. This will be a solid foundation for further lessons – larger amounts of pocket money and how to manage it with longer intervals between receipts by the child. It is important to remember that the world is becoming more and more cashless and we buy a lot of products online now than before, therefore, even in the school canteen it might soon be possible to pay only by card.

If it is not followed regularly, it will be difficult to assess the benefits of pocket money. When giving your child pocket money, do it at regular intervals. Then lengthen the interval over time – for example, if you gave it daily at first, after a while you can start giving it only a few times or just once a week (for example, on Mondays and Wednesdays, then only on Mondays. As the child gets the hang of managing their pocket money, you can lengthen the interval even further for example, on the 1st and 15th days of the of the month. This way the child learns to plan and spend. After all, we get paid on time, and delays can be distressing.

Why? Because this experience will be enormously valuable and will help them avoid more serious financial mistakes in the future. It’s better to make small mistakes now than big financial mistakes in the future. It is much better to lose 5 euros when you are 7 than to spend a whole month's salary in the first few days even before paying utility bills and rent when they are 20 years-old. It might be hard to fathom now that your child might make such mistakes in the future, but the truth is that even amongst ourselves we have carelessly spent on so many occasions and wished we planned that better. In my experience, I constantly hear stories of children who have started living independently who do not understand many basic things about managing finances. This is not because they are careless. Young people simply lack the knowledge of financial literacy and basic communication with parents on the subject of money.
