In a business that works efficiently - it is important to make plans not only for a year, but for five years, for a decade and so forth. Otherwise, the successful and long-term existence of the company is difficult to imagine. Many of us are no exception – as the new year has already begun , many of us have set goals for ourselves . Some do it recklessly , driven by a sense of “bandwagon effect”, whilst the others plan almost every area of life responsibly and in detail .

A child rarely saves just for the sake of saving. Most often, savings are made for some specific purpose - a toy, a computer, a phone, etc. When a child reaches a goal,the joy it brings is palpable. The child also feels like the true owner of the purchase because they achieved the goal by themselves. However, goals are not only financial, so I recommend discussing this with children as early as possible. When it comes to goals of children, one thing is clear – children usually do not often think about the future and the consequences of their current actions. Fewer children manage to set goals and achieve them on their own, so our help at the initial stage is rather important. But there is one challenge – you need to try not to impose your opinion on your children instead encourage them to set goals and act independently. Otherwise, it is very likely that the efforts will be fruitless. In the end, achieving your own goals is much more fun and it is done with more self-motivation. Our intervention in the eyes of a child can turn us into demanding parents who give orders and impose opinions. In this case, achieving the goals that parents set for their children may simply be uninteresting and meaningless.")]),e._v(" "),t("img",{staticStyle:{"max-width":"80%","margin-top":"30px","margin-left":"auto","margin-right":"auto"},attrs:{src:"https://cdn.mytu.co/blog/en/blog-saving-phone.png",alt:"Mokėjimo kortelė vaikui, kortelė vaikui"}}),e._v(" "),t("blockquote",[t("p",[e._v('"The child also feels like the true owner of the purchase because they achieved the goal by themselves."')])]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("So, how can we act practically so that the goals that are set have a positive impact on the development of children? How can we stop being critics or moralists, instead become assistants who pass by and gently guide children in the right direction? As with many other areas, your own example will help here. Share with your child what goals you set for yourself and the actions you take to achieve them. If you don't do this, you can tell them about the positive examples from your work. You can also find inspiring stories in the biographies of famous people, especially athletes.

For both the young and older children, a visualised plan will aid this process It should be posted in a visible place in the child’s room and to remind them of the goals set by them. They can be either written down or drawn (especially suitable for kids who don't know how to write yet). It is very useful for the child if you help them mark intermediate actions of each goal, wherein the child makes a mark, paints, or sticks stickers,thus, sees themselves approaching the goal, which motivates them even more to complete the rest. For example, a child has set a goal to learn how to play a certain melody. To achieve this goal, he decides to devote 30 minutes every evening to music lessons, and marks in the plan the days of the week when the task was completed. There is a lot of room for creativity here.
