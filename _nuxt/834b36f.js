Of couse, the familiarity with money and the initial lessons begin precisely with the development of this skill – and that's not bad. I have noticed that many children today are excellent at saving money for their goals. But financial literacy isn't just about saving. It is a broader field that includes not only various money management skills, but also psychological (attitudes and beliefs), economic (macro factors that affect one's financial situation), and social (how family, friends, school, etc. affect finances) fascets. Therefore, it is evident that saving is just one part of it.

Store shelves are overflowing with a variety of toys and treats, and it is especially difficult to resist advertising to children. Therefore, feel free to talk to your children about how to spend money wisely. For example, before buying something, compare prices in different stores and online, and suggest to wait for discounts. It is also worth discussing whether the desired item is needed at all! Perhaps it's worth waiting a few days (the 72-hour rule) and if the motivation doesn't wane, you can make the desired purchase. You may also find cheaper alternatives for the desired purchase. I have noticed that children willingly engage in such discussions and enthusiastically find alternatives to their desires without spending money instantly. Therefore, feel free to discuss together and share your experience. Remember, your experience is also a great lesson for children.

The most basic example is earning from a bottle return system or additional work. It is important to teach a child's responsibilities, such as tidying up the toys, making the bed, washing the dishes or doing well in school, but in my opinion, these are not things they should be paid for. However, it is always possible to find additional work for which the agreed remuneration can be paid. With age, work can expand outside the home – to grandparents, neighbours or even more widely in the community. Today, there are many examples of children starting their own businesses capitalising on the internet and earning their first income quite early in life.

If the child is not educated on this topic, from the first euro earned, it can become a huge challenge in the future. After all, you wouldn't want your child living paycheck to paycheck as an adult, or worse – drowning in debt or having no financial stability.

This is a wonderful example of how to engage children in the sharing process and teach a valuable life lesson.
