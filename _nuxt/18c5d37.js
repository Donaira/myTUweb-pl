We can help children form a positive atitude towards the value of money and saving from a young age. So when you communicate with children, try to convey the message that saving is indeed fun.

One may often wonder when is the right time to save. While it may be inconvenient for some, now is the best time to save if you haven’t begun efficiently saving already. You have probably heard that it’s important to set aside at least 10% of your income and increase this percentage over time. People usually wait until the time is right to start saving, which in extreme circumstances can lead to dire financial consequences. If the habit of saving is begun early, there’s a good chance it will become a continuous habit with many financial benefits in the long run. Children can be taught from an early age how to effectively set aside money as savings. Like brushing the teeth, it can become a habit that’s going to last a lifetime and be passed down to the next generations. Eventually, they will start saving – not only to achieve any dreams or goals, but to also be financially sound in the future. ")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("In order to spend wisely and save, a crucial step in personal finance management is to divide the money and allocate it to specific areas as soon as you receive your income. This may be for fixed costs like rent, or other expenses like education, charity, entertainment, and also for savings and investment. When money is set aside appropriately, one often avoids the will to spend beyond their means. It also guarantees that they have set aside funds as savings. If parents help their children develop this habit from an early age, there is a high probability that they will learn to manage their finances well as an adult and avoid painful consequences arising from not saving. In this regard, it’s good to maintain different savings accounts for different purposes. To help visualise the goal for children, you can help them label piggy banks with written goals.

Saving without a plan can lead to disappointing results or the lack of willingness to continue, especially amongst children. When a goal is instilled, the activity of saving is all the more merrier. It is better to calculate a savings goal for the child so there is a goal to aim towards and effectively save. Even kids who are 3-4 years-old can learn to begin saving for small goals. For example, my 3 year-old son and I have set a savings goal and monitor the progress. I created a savings plan where my son has to draw and colour a coin in a chart when he tosses a coin into the piggy bank. We then hung this chart in a visible place in his room. This visualisation helps him stay on track, monitor progress and desire the positive outcome when the savings goal is achieved. Planning also helps to avoid unnecessary purchases in a store. Everytime the child requests something, I can remind him about the savings goal and how it will be affected if money is spent on gratification now. It has a tremendous success rate as well.

It is much easier for the child to understand how much has already been saved when they can see it clearly. It also does a lot in terms of motivating them to continue. When setting goals, it’s important to pay attention to the age and maturity of the child. The younger ones should start with smaller goals as they haven’t the patience to pursue a goal for a long period. As the child grows, the saving method can be enhanced. Instead of a glass jar, a personal account might be a decent upgrade. They can create a savings account, set a goal, label it, and start saving. Saving comes with discipline. With the help of some rules, it is possible to enrich the child’s understanding of money and develop useful qualities that lead to higher financial literacy.
